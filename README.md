### Hearing frequency range testing app

This simple JustPy-based webapp allows the user to test the limits of their
hearing, compare these results with the bulk of results from previous users
and obtain a pdf certificate describing their hearing range.

This app is not deployed anywhere and can only work locally. A similar version
of this app can also be found here:
