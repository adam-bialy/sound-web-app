### Hearing frequency range testing app

This simple JustPy-based webapp allows the user to test the limits of their
hearing, compare these results with the bulk of results from previous users
and obtain a pdf certificate describing their hearing range.

It cannot be deployed on a remote server due to the fact that sound is generated 
in the backend. Another incarnation of this application is in the works.
